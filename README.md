Flutter JNI Bindings for OkHttp
This repository contains a Flutter application that demonstrates how to use JNI (Java Native Interface) bindings to interact with the OkHttp library, allowing Dart code to leverage the functionality of Java-based HTTP clients. The app provides a simple user interface to enter a URL and fetch the response from a remote server.

Features
JNI Bindings: Uses JNI to connect Dart with Java’s OkHttp library.
OkHttp Integration: Makes HTTP requests with the Java OkHttp client directly from Dart.
Simple UI: Enter a URL, press a button, and see the response.
Error Handling: Displays a message if the input URL is invalid.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Flutter SDK: Install Flutter
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure JDK is installed and configured in your environment.
Android Studio or VS Code (optional): Recommended IDEs for Flutter development.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-jni-okhttp.git
cd flutter-jni-okhttp
Install Flutter dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Configure JNI Bindings: Ensure the native Java code is properly integrated with JNI. The jni_bindings.dart file must contain the appropriate bindings to interface with the OkHttp Java code.

Running the Application
To run the app on an Android emulator or connected device:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
If you encounter any issues, ensure that:

Your Android device or emulator is connected and running.

You have accepted all necessary Android licenses with:

bash
Copy code
flutter doctor --android-licenses
How It Works
This app utilizes JNI bindings to call Java’s OkHttp library from Dart. The following classes and methods demonstrate the key functionality:

Key Functionalities
OkHttpClient:
Creates a new HTTP client instance to handle requests.

Request_Builder:
Constructs an HTTP request object using the provided URL.

url1: Accepts a URL string wrapped in a JString object.
build: Finalizes the request.
Making the Request:

The execute() method sends the request and waits for the server’s response.
Error Handling:
If an invalid URL is entered, the application catches the error and displays an appropriate message.

Code Snippet
Here’s a key snippet from main.dart that demonstrates sending an HTTP request using the JNI bindings:

dart
Copy code
void _sendRequest(String url) {
  setState(() {
    try {
      // Build the request using the Request_Builder
      request = request_builder.url1(JString.fromString(url)).build();
      
      // Execute the HTTP request using OkHttpClient
      Response response = okHttpClient.newCall(request).execute();

      // Display the response
      resp = response.toString();
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle invalid URL errors
      resp = "Invalid url";
    }
  });
}
Demo
Launch the App:
Run the app on an emulator or connected device.

Enter a URL:
Type a valid HTTP URL into the text field (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1).

Send the Request:
Press the Send Request button (the floating action button) to fetch the response.

View the Response:
The response will be displayed on the screen. If the URL is invalid, it will display "Invalid url".

Screenshots
